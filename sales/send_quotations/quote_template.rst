   On each template, you can also specify discounts if the option is activated in the **Sales**
   settings. The base price is set in the product configuration and can be changed by customer
   pricelists.

Design your template

to manage what clients will see before accepting and paying the quotation. For example, you will
be able to describe your company, your services and your products. To do so, you can click on
**Edit** and you will be brought to the quotation editor.

.. tip::
   You can select any template of your choice and suggest it as the default template in
   the **Sales** settings.

Confirm the quotation
=====================

Templates facilitate the confirmation process by allowing customers to sign electronically or to
pay online. You can activate these two options directly in the quotation template itself.
